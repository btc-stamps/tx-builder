# JSR Publishing Validation Summary

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Clean Publishing - No Flags Needed!

### Completed Setup

1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Repository**: Created at `github.com/btc-stamps/tx-builder`
2. ‚úÖ **npm Token**: Added to GitHub Secrets as `NPM_TOKEN`
3. ‚úÖ **Workflows Configured**: Both workflows have correct OIDC permissions
4. ‚úÖ **JSR Package Structure**: Valid and ready for publishing
5. ‚úÖ **GitHub Account**: Linked to JSR

### JSR Configuration Verified

- Package name: `@btc-stamps/tx-builder@0.1.0`
- OIDC permissions: `id-token: write` configured in workflows
- Publish command: `deno publish` (clean, no flags needed!)
- Package validates successfully with `--dry-run`

## üîß Important Notes

### TypeScript Issues - ‚úÖ RESOLVED!

All TypeScript issues have been fixed:

- Clean type checking passes
- No special flags needed
- Full .d.ts generation for Node.js users

### What You Need to Do Now

#### 1. Authorize Repository on JSR (CRITICAL!)

After pushing to GitHub, you MUST:

1. Visit [jsr.io](https://jsr.io)
2. Go to your account settings
3. Look for "GitHub Repository Permissions" or "Authorized Repositories"
4. **Add `btc-stamps/tx-builder` to authorized repositories**
5. This step is REQUIRED even though OIDC is configured!

#### 2. Push to GitHub

```bash
# From your tx-builder directory
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: @btc-stamps/tx-builder v0.1.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/btc-stamps/tx-builder.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 3. Run Release Workflow

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Initial Release (v0.1.0)" workflow
3. Run with `dry_run = true` first
4. If successful, run with `dry_run = false`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminder

**JSR Repository Authorization**: Without authorizing the repository on JSR, the publish will fail with "permission denied" even though OIDC is set up correctly.

2. **The authorization flow**:
   - Your GitHub account is linked to JSR ‚úÖ
   - The workflow has OIDC permissions ‚úÖ
   - But JSR still needs explicit permission to accept publishes from `btc-stamps/tx-builder` repository

3. **Expected workflow behavior**:
   - npm publish will work immediately (token is set)
   - JSR publish will only work after repository authorization

## üéØ Success Indicators

When everything is working:

- GitHub Actions workflow shows green checkmarks
- Package appears at https://npmjs.com/package/@btc-stamps/tx-builder
- Package appears at https://jsr.io/@btc-stamps/tx-builder
- No authentication errors in workflow logs
- Clean JSR publishing without warnings

## üìù Troubleshooting

If JSR publish fails with "permission denied":

1. Double-check repository is authorized on JSR
2. Ensure you have publish rights to `@btc-stamps` scope
3. Verify the repository name matches exactly: `btc-stamps/tx-builder`

If npm publish fails:

1. Verify `NPM_TOKEN` is set in GitHub Secrets
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Ensure you're a member of `@btc-stamps` org on npm
