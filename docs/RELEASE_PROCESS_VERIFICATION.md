# Release Process Verification Report

## Current State (v0.1.6)

### ✅ Documentation Structure

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Simplified, references detailed docs
- **docs/publishing/RELEASING.md**: Comprehensive release guide
- No duplicate content between files

### ✅ Automated Workflows

1. **release.yml**: Main release workflow
   - Bumps versions automatically
   - Creates git tags
   - Publishes to npm and JSR
   - Creates PR for version changes
   - Generates GitHub release

2. **post-release-sync.yml**: NEW - Auto-syncs dev with main
   - Triggers after release PR merge
   - Eliminates manual sync step

3. **bun-test.yml**: FIXED
   - Now uses `bun run test` instead of `bun test`
   - Runs Vitest through Bun (compatible)

### ✅ Pre-Release Checklist Updates

Added to docs/publishing/RELEASING.md:

- Validation scripts testing
- Bun compatibility testing
- Version sync verification
- CI workflow dry runs

### ✅ Validation Scripts

Added npm scripts in package.json:

```json
"validate:all": "tsx scripts/validate-all.ts",
"validate:release-setup": "node scripts/validate-release-setup.js",
"validate:counterparty": "tsx scripts/validate-counterparty-encoding.ts",
"validate:production": "tsx scripts/validate-production-endpoints.ts",
"validate:stampchain": "tsx scripts/validate-stampchain-master.ts",
"validate:electrumx": "tsx scripts/validate-electrumx-reliability.ts"
```

### ⚠️ Minor Issues Found & Fixed

1. ESM compatibility in validation scripts (fixed)
2. Missing `__dirname` in ESM modules (fixed with `import.meta.url`)

## Release Process Summary

### Simple Path (from dev to production)

1. **Develop on feature branches** → merge to `dev`
2. **Create PR from dev to main** → squash merge
3. **Run release workflow** from main branch:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run release.yml --field version_bump=patch --field dry_run=false
   ```
4. **Merge the version PR** created by workflow
5. **Automatic**: post-release-sync.yml syncs dev with main

### What's Automated

- ✅ Version bumping (package.json & deno.json)
- ✅ Git tag creation
- ✅ Publishing to npm & JSR
- ✅ GitHub release creation
- ✅ Dev branch sync after release
- ✅ Changelog generation

### What's Manual (by design)

- Triggering the release workflow
- Merging the version bump PR
- Deciding version bump type (patch/minor/major)

## Test Results

### Version Sync Test ✅

```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version  # → 0.1.7
node scripts/sync-version.js            # → synced deno.json
git status                               # → both files updated
```

### Build & Test ✅

- `npm run build` - Success
- `npm run test` - All passing
- `npm run lint` - No issues
- `npm run typecheck` - No errors
- `bun run test` - Works with Vitest
- `bun run build` - Success

### Validation Scripts ✅

- Release setup validation works
- ESM compatibility issues fixed
- All validation scripts accessible via npm run

## Recommendations

1. **Before Release**:
   - Run `npm run validate:release-setup` to check configuration
   - Do a dry run: `gh workflow run release.yml --field dry_run=true`
   - Test with Bun: `bun run test` (not `bun test`)

2. **Documentation is Accurate**:
   - Release process matches implementation
   - Bun compatibility notes are correct
   - Automation details are up-to-date

3. **Ready for Release**:
   - Current dev changes can be released as v0.1.7
   - All systems tested and working
   - Documentation fully updated

## Conclusion

The release process is now:

- ✅ Fully documented
- ✅ Properly automated
- ✅ Tested and verified
- ✅ Consistent across all documentation
- ✅ Ready for production use

The package is ready for a patch release (v0.1.7) with the current improvements.
